 * The first list holds blocks of the minimum size M.  The second list holds blocks of size 2M.
 * The third list holds blocks of size 3M.  The fourth list holds blocks whose size is in the
 * interval (3M, 5M].  The fifth list holds blocks whose size is in the interval (5M, 8M],
 * and so on.  This continues up to the list at index NUM_FREE_LISTS-1 (i.e. 8), which
 * contains blocks whose size is greater than 34M.
 *
 * Each of the circular, doubly linked lists has a "dummy" block used as the list header.
 * This dummy block is always linked between the last and the first element of the list.
 * In an empty list, the next and free pointers of the list header point back to itself.
 * In a list with something in it, the next pointer of the header points to the first node
 * in the list and the previous pointer of the header points to the last node in the list.
 * The header itself is never removed from the list and it contains no data (only the link
 * fields are used).  The reason for doing things this way is to avoid edge cases in insertion
 * and deletion of nodes from the list.
